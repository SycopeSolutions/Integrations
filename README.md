# Sycope Integration Templates

Welcome to the official repository for custom **Sycope integration templates**!  
This repository is designed to help end users seamlessly synchronize data between Sycope and third-party platforms such as **Suricata**, **Zabbix**, and others.

Each integration includes:
- Detailed manuals
- In-line comments and documentation
- Ready-to-use scripts for rapid deployment

Weâ€™re excited to share these resources with the community and support efficient, flexible integrations tailored to your needs.
